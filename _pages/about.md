Hi! I am a first year PhD student at Univeristy of British Columbia (UBC) CS advised by [Vered Shwartz](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~vshwartz/) and [Raymond NG](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/people/raymond-ng) in the [Natural Language processing group](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/cs-research/lci/research-groups/natural-language-processing/). My research interests lie broadly in Natural Language Processing, Machine learning and commonsense reasoning. 

I am also a part of the core [OpenML](https://github.com/openml/OpenML) team. Before coming to UBC, I worked as a Research Engineer in the Machine Learning lab at Eindhoven University of Technology, The Netherlands. I am lucky to have worked with amazing researchers such as [Joaquin Vanschoren](https://joaquinvanschoren.github.io/home/#lab) and [Mykola Pechenizkiy](https://www.win.tue.nl/~mpechen/).  My goal here was to democratize machine learning by making it more accessible, automated, reproducible and interpretable.
